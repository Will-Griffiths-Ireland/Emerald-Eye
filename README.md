##Commercial Viability (Business Model) 

People like good photos, they tell stories, they stir emotions, they connect us with things we love. 

The business model for Emerald Eye is to be a frictionless environment for artists to sell their work. The hook is that this site is for Irish artists promoting images taken in Ireland. 

The upfront costs with this business are low since it will be entirely web based and hosting costs will really only increase with site traffic (and sales) 

Printing/framing will be outsourced initially and brought inhouse if demand reaches a point where economies of scale make this practical. 

I have experience with photography and will initially seed the site with my own work
