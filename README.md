## Commercial Viability (Business Model) 

People like good photos, they tell stories, they stir emotions, they connect us with things we love. 

The business model for Emerald Eye is to be a frictionless environment for artists to sell their work. The hook is that this site is for Irish artists promoting images taken in Ireland, all purely in digital format. 

The upfront costs with this business are low since it will be entirely web based and hosting costs will really only increase with site traffic (and sales) 

The desire for printed artwork, and the associated costs, has lessened in favor of high resolution digital files that allow for a custom experince displayed on devies such as LGs Art Tv's. Emerald Eye seeks to capitialise on these desires for more high quality conentent at an affordable price.

## Site Design

The overall design of the site is tailored towards minilism and focusing on the art itself. Initially I was going to allow users to just upload as many images as they wanted directly, but this raised concerns over inaproriate content and a flood of low quality content. The approach I decided on was a more curated and personal touch, much like a small art gallery.



### Wireframes

The site follows a classic approach and the wireframes were the intitial concept that I knew would align with a trnaditional store format and would be qucik to implement with bootstrap.

The pdf can be found here

### Color Schemes

The colour scheme of the site leans heavily on the colours of the Irish flag

Green - #385723
White = #ffffff
Gold - #ffc000

### Fonts

I landed on using the 'Lilita One' font, it really just came from testing out multiple fonts till I found one that had the right vibe
