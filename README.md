## Commercial Viability (Business Model) 

People like good photos, they tell stories, they stir emotions, they connect us with things we love. 

The business model for Emerald Eye is to be a frictionless environment for artists to sell their work. The hook is that this site is for Irish artists promoting images taken in Ireland, all purely in digital format. 

The upfront costs with this business are low since it will be entirely web based and hosting costs will really only increase with site traffic (and sales) 

The desire for printed artwork, and the associated costs, has lessened in favor of high resolution digital files that allow for a custom experince displayed on devies such as LGs Art Tv's. Emerald Eye seeks to capitialise on these desires for more high quality conentent at an affordable price.
